# reactionary-group

The #reactionaryGroup is a set of four Twitter bot characters users can control. Each character represents an opposing political personality that exists within social media platforms: a liberal, a conservative, a conspiracy theorist, and a member of the alt-right. 

Their tweets are always linked to one another, in the form of an argument. They are not automated but rely on crowdsourcing to foster a discussion on the online platforms we use and the news sources we read. My piece gives the user agency to spread fake news by tweeting for these personalities. My objective for to gather as many varied viewpoints into who these personalities represent and what you think they would say.
